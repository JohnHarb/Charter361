Most of group members agree then we put policy in list below:

Policies:

Code should be commented to completion. This means there should be no questions as to a class or functions intentions.
Upon checking in code group member will tag @all to inform team code has been checked in and request peer review/merge.
Variables will be named based off the content they contain. For example the number of eggs may be called numEgg
Variables will be named in camelcase
Functions will be named based off their intended use. For example a function that averages a list of scores may be called avScore
Functions will be named in camelcase
  

6. Procedure for handling a member who is not meeting expectations, must include at least 3 actions before involving the instructor

a. Group member is tagged in discord for confirmation/ discussion. Group member will have 24 hours to respond and address the issue.
b. Group member will be emailed with initial pre-escalation contact, information regarding the attempted discord contact, and summary of expectations as a result of email. Group member will have 24 hours to reply to this email.
c. Group member will be notified via email that their failure to comply has been documented, and the consequences of this (for example, another member is assigned their task). Group member is advised that failure to respond affirmatively to this email will result in instructor escalation.
